      "The admission on Jan. 18 by Matthias Sauer, Apple’s director of cellular systems architecture, is the kind of point Qualcomm will have to score in front of U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh as it continues its defense against antitrust allegations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  The government has charged it with using market dominance in smartphone chips to force phone makers to pay inflated patent licensing revenue.  Sauer testified that Apple considered the likes of Ericsson, Broadcom and Intel Corp. as component suppliers for devices as early as the 2012 planning phase for new products, but none could deliver to Apple’s desired specifications.\n",

      "Shares of iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) are starting to show some life after spending several quarters in the hurt locker. IQ stock has been off to a quick start this year, bolting higher by more than 24%. However, it's still down big over the past three and six months, falling more 21.5% and 44%, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week though, iQiyi stock showed signs of breaking out, heaping some confidence on investors that the worst may be over. Is that the case and is IQ stock really breaking out? Perhaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "While iQiyi remains a volatile name in the short term, I continue to like IQ because of its long-term potential. When you hear a company described as &quot;the Netflix of China,&quot; it certainly gets your attention. While Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has its own issues, it's hard to deny what it has done to the video content industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, Netflix isn't allowed in China, which has allowed a company called iQiyi to blossom. Like Netflix, IQ doesn't have the greatest financial situation in the world -- it's not Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) -- but it has incredible subscriber growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evaluation IQ Stock\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters, the entire Chinese equity market continues to feel pressure as economic data out of China signals concern and as the trade war wears on. It doesn't matter that IQ stock is listed on the Nasdaq, as all Chinese stocks simply remain under selling pressure. So what does that mean for iQiyi?\n",
      "\n",
      "In all truth, the trade war has very little to no direct impact on iQiyi's business. The economic slowdown likely doesn't help, but it seems like iQiyi at least has a defensible moat much like Netflix would during a recession. Again, this isn't a positive catalyst, but all things considered, I would consider iQiyi in a better position than a number of other companies.\n",

      "Earlier this month, Bernstein analysts slapped an underperform rating and a dreadful $11 price target on the stock. It feels like analysts and others are looking for this company to be on the brink of profitability and churning out positive cash flow despite still being in its early years. While the company may not be there yet, we have to realize that it needs a massive base of subscribers before it can really take flight. Those who are patient have the potential to reap big rewards from this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "On October 30th, iQiyi reported its third-quarter results. A loss of 4.34 yuan per share badly missed expectations for a loss of 2.81 yuan per share and management needs to tighten up a bit in this regard. That said, revenue exploded 48% to 6.9 billion yuan (roughly $1 billion) while subscriber growth boomed 89% to 80.7 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Understand that iQiyi is not a perfect mirror of Netflix. However, it runs a subscription segment similar to Netflix and an ad-based model similar to YouTube. So while the subscriber growth is impressive, realize that it's not all monthly paying subscribers. Consider that in its third quarter, Netflix had revenue of $4 billion and total subscribers of 130 million. Based on those numbers and NFLX's now $148 billion valuation, it makes iQiyi seem too discounted at just $13.3 billion.\n",

Even if this recent rally ends up fizzling out, just getting to this point is a positive development. If shares can hold up above this level and stay above short-term uptrend support (blue line), IQ stock could put together a rally up to the 100-day moving average.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the charts are looking good right now, bulls must be careful. IQ stock has been incredibly weak over the past seven months.

      "As the U.S. markets slowly recover from their woes over the past few months, Apple (NASDAQ:APPL) stock remains one of the most followed. Over the last few months, a lot of bad news has fallen on AAPL. As a result, since becoming the first U.S. company with a market cap of over $1 trillion in early August, Apple stock has fallen from an all-time high of $233.47 on Oct. 3, 2018 to $142 on Jan. 3, 2019.\n",

      "Investors' shift in mood since the end of summer 2018 did not affect Apple stock alone, as technology stocks in general have been under pressure thanks to overall fear and uncertainty that has been bearing down on the market.

      "\n",
      "Potential Trade War &quot;Truce&quot;: Over the past few weeks, we have witnessed a relief rally, both in the broader equity markets and in Apple stock following reports of a possible trade wars &quot;truce&quot; between the U.S and China. Almost 20% of Apple's revenues come from sales within China, thus the trade war discourse of 2018 has affected the AAPL stock price negatively. In case of an actual trade deal between the two countries, the market's risk appetite is likely to increase and Apple shares could jump to higher levels fast.\n",

      "Potential Halt in Federal Reserve Rate Hikes: Recently, various Federal Reserve officials have discussed economic scenarios for a pause in its proposed interest-rate hiking decision for 2019. In 2018, the AAPL stock price suffered from rising rates, as increased rates strengthened the U.S. dollar and hurt AAPL's bottom line.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company's SEC filing clearly identifies the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations as well as tariffs on AAPL earnings. Almost half of Apple's sales come from Pacific Rim countries as well as Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The weakening of foreign currencies has translated into lower earnings for Apple; therefore, a pause in rate hikes would help Apple stock find a longer-term bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Potential Revenue Increase in Services: Apple's reach to a trillion dollars several months ago was partly paved with iPhones and iPads, as well as Macs. It was also assisted by a record number of stock buybacks from the company. But those shareholders who remain committed to AAPL stock realize the importance of its highly profitable division, i.e., Apple Services, which includes the App Store, Apple Pay, iTunes, AppleCare and Apple Music, for the current and future bottom line.\n",
      "\n",
      "These services help consumers get more benefit and enjoyment from their Apple products. AAPL's revenue from Services division has grown over 50% in two years, making it the second-largest division behind the iPhone division. Apple has been working hard to increase subscribers to its various services. For example, Apple recently announced a partnership deal in the U.S. with Verizon (NYSE:VZ), the largest wireless provider in the country, whereby subscribers to Verizon's several premium cellular plans will also have a complementary Apple Music subscription.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the margins have decreased on its products, AAPL shareholders would now like to see more data (i.e., transparency) released on Apple Services, along with a larger percentage of consolidated gross profit coming from Services. Driving more revenue and profit from Services will provide the next impetus for growth and the related increase in Apple stock price.\n",
      "\n",
      "### What Could Derail AAPL Stock in the Short-term?\n",
      "\n",
      "When Apple reports earnings on Jan. 29, investors will pay extremely close attention to the details in the company's quarterly results. Any disappointment in Apple's earnings statement or future outlook could easily send AAPL stock back below $150 to test its previous lows. Therefore, there might be weakness in the AAPL stock price in the near-term that potential investors should anticipate.\n",

And, eventually, management would make the proper decisions to move the company forward. Therefore, patient investors who continue to believe in the AAPL story may see any price dip below the $150 level as an opportunity to go long AAPL stock and ride out the daily volatility. In two to three years, I expect these investors to be rewarded handsomely.\n",

      "\n",
      "Revenue Warning: Apple started the year by shocking its investors. On Jan. 2, Tim Cook released a letter that included the following statement: &quot;Based on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance.&quot;\n",
      "\n",
      "At first blush, that may not seem like huge news. However, it's important to remember that AAPL hadn't issued a revenue warning since 2002. For all its ups and downs, it never missed so badly on a phone-upgrade cycle that it had to issue a revenue warning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recent shortfall didn't come totally out of the blue. Apple's decision to stop reporting unit sales last year was a clear indicator that things were starting to go dreadfully wrong for the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the size of the miss was dramatic. On last quarter's earnings call, the company estimated that its revenues for its December quarter would be $89 billion to $93 billion. In Cook's letter, the outlook was slashed to just $84 billion. This shows that Apple's management had a terrible read on the outlook of demand for its products.\n",

      "China Issues: It's not hard to see what caused the miss. In his letter, Cook noted that all of the year-over-year decline in revenues were due to falling sales in China.

      "Adding to the concern, on Friday Reuters reported that key Apple supplier Foxconn is cutting 50,000 contract jobs. It's normal for Foxconn to lay off workers on a seasonal basis as demand fluctuates. However, its most recent layoffs came months sooner than usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, it was reported that AAPL had asked its suppliers to prepare for a 10% decline in phone production. The layoffs by Foxconn confirm that speculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "App Store Problems: Those who are bullish on Apple stock say that the growth of the company's services revenue will boost the shares. Wall Street loves services revenue, as it tends to consist of subscription revenue or other recurring income. That is the case for AAPL; it earns tons of recurring money from its app store.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, AB Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi thinks that AAPL could lose some of this revenue.CNBC recently described Sacconaghi's thesis:\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of that regular Services revenue, Apple charges between 15 percent and 30 percent of monthly subscriptions for customers who buy software via the iOS App Store, a fee that's come to be known as the &quot;Apple Tax.&quot; Any time a a user buys an iOS app, a digital item within an iOS app (e.g., an ebook) or initiates a subscription within an iOS app (e.g., a New York Times subscription), Apple takes a 30 percent cut for the first year and 15 percent for all subsequent years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately for Apple, more and more companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Spotify (NASDAQ:SPOT) are trying to avoid paying this &quot;Apple Tax&quot;. Given the powerful position of some of these leading apps, they can credibly threaten to leave the app store if they don't get a much better deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's services segment grew 18% last quarter, with the 30% app store &quot;tax&quot; driving nearly half of that revenue growth. If the tax revenue goes away, AAPL will have difficulty growing its overall services revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Pros of Apple Stock\n",
      "\n",
      "Attractive Forward Returns: I've been bearish on Apple stock in the past. Last summer, for example, I suggested that Apple would be a victim of the Winner's Curse. In other words, I contended that because AAPL was the largest company in the world, it would have trouble continuing to grow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I wrote that column, Apple stock has tanked. More recently, in December, I estimated Apple's 2023 earnings per share and derived a 2023 price target for Apple stock of $233. Since the price of Apple stock was  $175 at the time, I didn't think that AAPL was a great investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the price of Apple stock now $155, however, $233 is starting to look pretty nice. If AAPL stock ends 2023 at $233, a buyer of AAPL stock today will earn more than 8% per year from the appreciation of Apple stock price. Throw in the dividend, and the investor's annual return rises to more than 10%. That's not a home run, by any means, but it's a very solid performance from a relatively conservative, blue-chip stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Discounted Valuation: Related to the previous point, AAPL stock finally looks compellingly cheap. I've long criticized the stock for being overvalued, given the minimal growth prospects of AAPL. After last year's selloff of Apple stock, however, the market has finally priced in this reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Down here under $160 per share, Apple stock is selling at just 13 times AAPL's trailing earnings and 12 times its forward earnings. Additionally, the stock's price-sales ratio has fallen under three. Since 2010, the price-sales ratio of Apple stock has only fallen below three for two brief periods; once for a few months in 2014 and for one quarter in 2016. Both turned out to be fantastic buying opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improving Macroeconomic Conditions: I still believe that we'll get a resolution of the U.S.-China trade war fairly soon. Recent headlines suggest that President Trump is looking for a speedy resolution to try to boost the stock market and may make concessions to get there.\n",
      "\n",
      "A thaw in the trade war would be great news for Apple, as its recent revenue shortfall was mostly caused by slowing Chinese sales, according to AAPL. On top of that, the recovery of the stock market and the strengthened economic outlook should help bolster both Apple's revenues and Apple stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Verdict on Apple Stock\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's era of rapid growth has ended. I've been saying that for a long time, and the market has now come to that conclusion as well. However, AAPL stock can still make you money, now that it has firmly transitioned from a growth play to a value name.\n",
      "\n",
      "I expect Apple stock price to head back over $200 over the next couple of years. The combination of the company's  stock buyback, its dividend, and its stable, robust cash flows is great for conservative, income-seeking investors. While AAPL stock is unlikely to deliver spectacular returns again anytime soon, it can be a solid contributor to your portfolio.\n",

      "The volatility of Roku stock can be chalked up to the enormous variation in Roku's potential future performance.\n",

In this scenario, Roku stock could be worth a lot one day.\n",

      "\n",
      "As a result, Roku stock could be worth nothing, in the future, it could be worth $20 billion-plus one day, or it could end up being worth anything in between. That's a wide range, so wide that it explains the high volatility of Roku stock price.\n",
      "\n",
      "This volatility will eventually subside as the company's range of outcomes narrows in the future after it has grown. But the valuation of Roku stock will ultimately be at the upper end of the $0-$20 billion range, so the narrowing process will boost Roku stock.\n",

      "### Positive Developments Make the Bull Thesis on Roku Stock More Likely\n",
      "\n",
      "In late 2018, the market seemingly forgot that Roku is likely to remain a key component of the rapidly growing streaming market over the long-term. But in 2019, there have been multiple positive developments which have reminded investors that Roku is a growth company. Consequently, Roku stock has rallied this month.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, Roku added paid subscriptions to Roku Channel, thereby allowing subscribers to watch paid programming from Showtime, Starz, and Epix through the Roku Channel. Second, Roku reported strong fourth-quarter engagement numbers that included a 40% increase in active accounts and nearly 70% growth of streaming hours. Third, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) backed out of plans to launch a streaming service, showing that streaming is hard to do, and that Roku has a big enough moat to keep big competitors away.\n",
      "\n",
      "All together, these positive developments underscore that Roku continues to innovate, expand, and grow at a rapid rate, perhaps so quickly that it is deterring other companies from entering the space. That's a major positive development for Roku stock. It means that the bear thesis that competitors will squash Roku and Roku stock is overstated. It also means that the bull thesis of ROKU turning into a major streaming player continues to gain traction.\n",

      "### Increased Size Will Bring Increased Stability\n",
      "\n",
      "It's difficult to predict the long-term fate of small companies, so they tend to be highly volatile. As those small companies grow, though, investors gain visibility into their long-term outlook, the range of possible outcomes narrows, and their stocks become more stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "This process will be favorable for ROKU.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roku is really small right now. The company has just 27 million active accounts, versus Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) 140 million paid members. Thus, the question right now is whether Roku will grow to 140 million members like Netflix or lose its 27 million members to bigger competitors like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors have been uncertain about the answer to that question. As a result, Roku bounced around wildly in 2017 and 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "These wild swings may slow in 2019. That's because ROKU has been a public company for six quarters and in each of those six quarters, its active account growth has been 40% or higher, while its streaming hours have increased by at least 50%.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is consistent and healthy growth which underscores that, regardless of the surrounding competitive environment, Roku 's continued leverage of technology and network effects have enabled it to remain a leader of the streaming device market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The longer Roku's growth remains consistent and large, the more likely the bulls' thesis will become, and the more investors will write off the bear thesis as inaccurate. As this happens, Roku stock price will rise, and at a much more steady and stable pace than has previously been the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Bottom Line on ROKU\n",
      "\n",
      "ROKU has been highly volatile over the past 16 months because it's been a small company with a wide range of possible outcomes. But Roku is getting bigger, and is it does, it is becoming increasingly clear that this company has staying power in the streaming market, which is poised to grow over the long-term. The clearer that becomes, the higher Roku stock price will go.\n",

      "As the market has rallied the past few weeks, so have shares of retail coffee giant Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). During this stretch, Starbucks stock is up 7%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things didn't look as good at the beginning of 2019. To kick off the year, one of the world's largest companies, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), fired a warning shot about rapidly slowing growth in China -- the world's hottest economy. Stocks broadly fell after that warning shot. But, it's been nothing but up, up, and away for markets since then. Following the Apple-led market selloff in early January, the S&P 500 has rallied an impressive 8% in under three weeks.\n",

As such, first quarter numbers -- due after the bell on Thursday, January 24 -- won't be very good, and they will likely include an Apple-like warning about slowing China growth going forward.\n",

      "That negative update isn't priced into Starbucks stock. Thus, not only could Starbucks fall after Q1 earnings, but it could also fall by quite a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "All together, while Starbucks is a long-term growth company that will ultimately head higher in a multi-year window, caution is warranted on Starbucks stock ahead of Q1 earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Numbers May Disappoint\n",
      "\n",
      "Last quarter, Starbucks reported headline revenue and earnings beats with above-consensus comparable sales growth and a healthy guide. The theme of the conference call was that expansion in the China market would offset slowing growth in U.S. market, and reinvigorate the overall growth narrative. Investors rallied around that idea. Starbucks stock has done nothing but grind higher since then.\n",
      "\n",
      "That puts Starbucks stock in a precarious position heading into Q1 earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anything has become clear since the last earnings report, it is that the Chinese economy is dramatically cooling off. Apple cut its quarterly guide in a big way due to slowing growth in China. China reported 6.6% GDP growth in 2018, the lowest annual pace in nearly 30 years. Q4 GDP growth was 6.4%, the slowest quarterly pace since the Financial Crisis. Other economic data coming out of China has been weak, including retail-sales growth rates hovering at 15 year lows.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is all bad news for Starbucks stock. The core of the near term bull thesis on SBUX is that China growth is going to pave a brighter future for this company, which has struggled with slowing growth over the past several years.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, that probably isn't happening yet. It's highly unlikely that Starbucks is bucking the broader China economic trend and putting up strong numbers in China. As such, China numbers this quarter will likely disappoint. If they do, the numbers globally will disappoint, too. Also, the tone on the conference call may be Apple-like, and include warnings about slowing growth going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Starbucks is heading into an earnings report which has the potential to be pretty bad. That isn't a favorable setup for Starbucks stock, especially at current valuation levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Valuation Doesn't Incorporate Disappointment\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day, it always comes down to numbers and valuation. For example, despite significant sales pressure in China, Apple stock is a buy here because it's trading at just 12x forward earnings, and is priced for all the bad news.\n",
      "\n",
      "That isn't true for Starbucks stock. Despite facing significant sales pressure in China like Apple, Starbucks stock doesn't trade at 12x forward earnings. Instead, it still trades at 25x forward earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is simply too big of a multiple for Starbucks stock. The whole restaurant industry trades at 22x forward earnings. Other major players in the quick service restaurant space like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Dunkin' (NYSE:DNKN), Yum(NYSE:YUM), Jack In The Box (NASDAQ:JACK) and El Pollo Loco (NASDAQ:LOCO) all trade around 18 to 23x forward earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, Starbucks stock warranted a premium valuation because of higher quality growth. That is no longer the case today. Comparable sales growth last quarter was just 3%. That is largely an industry average comparable sales growth rate (McDonald's was up above 4% last quarter, and Yum was at 2%). Thus, this is no longer a higher quality growth company, meaning the stock no longer deserves its premium valuation. Compression to the norm valuation across the QSR space implies ~10% valuation downside risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Bottom Line on SBUX Stock\n",
      "\n",
      "In the long term, Starbucks stock is a winner, powered by global brand leadership in the steady growth coffee retail industry. But, in the near term, Starbucks stock seems due for a correction as it rallies into an earnings report that will likely disappoint due to slowing China growth.\n",
